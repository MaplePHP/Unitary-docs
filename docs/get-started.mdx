# Get Started

Unitary is an evidence-based testing framework for practical PHP development. Each test is a set of validations that describe and confirm how your code behaves in real conditions

---

## Install Unitary


<details open>

  <summary>Local installation (recommended)</summary>

  Add Unitary as a development dependency:

  ```bash
  composer require --dev maplephp/unitary
  ```

  Run it using the local binary:

  ```bash
  php vendor/bin/unitary
  ```

</details>
<details>

  <summary>Global installation</summary>


    To use Unitary in any project:

    ```bash
    composer global require maplephp/unitary
    ```

    _Ensure Composer’s global `bin` path is in your system `PATH`_

    #### Now you can run:

    ```bash
    unitary
    ```

</details>
_Local gives consistency, global gives convenience. For most projects a local installation is best as it keeps Unitary tied to your code and version control._

## 1. Create your first test

Unitary automatically finds any PHP file starting with `unitary-` in your project (excluding vendor directory). This behavior can be changed by adding a config file.

> **Note** that all your project files are already autoloaded through Composer, so you can use any of your classes directly in tests, no manual includes or setup required.

#### Create a file named:

```
tests/unitary-user.php
```

#### Example test

```php
use MaplePHP\Unitary\TestCase;

group("Your grouped test subject", function (TestCase $case) {

    $case->expect(1 + 2)
        ->isEqualTo(2)
        ->validate("Addition must be correct"); // Will fail

});
```
**Note** that in Unitary it is recommended to place multiple tests within a group. Unitary is evidence-driven and will clearly report what failed, and why, when a failure occurs. You can also add additional evidence and descriptive messages to improve clarity. See the **[Write Tests](/docs/write-tests)** section for further details.

_You can also get a ready-to-use boilerplate code with `php vendor/bin/unitary template`_


---

## 2. Run your tests

Execute all discovered test groups:

```bash
php vendor/bin/unitary
```

_For help and all CLI options run `php vendor/bin/unitary --help`_

## Configuration

You don’t need to configure anything to start testing, Unitary runs the moment it’s installed.
It automatically discovers your test files, autoloads your project through Composer and prints clear validation results without any complicated setup.

When you want to customize its behavior, you can do this through the CLI or by adding a configuration file.

[Read Configuration →](/docs/configuration)

<details>
  <summary>Add a optional Composer script</summary>

  In your `composer.json`:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "php vendor/bin/unitary"
  }
  ```

  Run with:

  ```bash
  composer test
  ```

  Pass additional arguments using `--`:

  ```bash
  composer test -- --help
  ```
