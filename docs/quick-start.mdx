# Get Started

Unitary is a validation-first testing framework built for practical PHP development.
It treats each test as evidence — a set of validations that confirm how your code behaves in real conditions, with results that stay readable and precise even as projects grow.

---

## Install Unitary


<details open>

  <summary>Local installation (recommended)</summary>

  Add Unitary as a development dependency:

  ```bash
  composer require --dev maplephp/unitary
  ```

  Run it using the local binary:

  ```bash
  php vendor/bin/unitary
  ```

</details>
<details>

  <summary>Global installation</summary>


    To use Unitary in any project:

    ```bash
    composer global require maplephp/unitary
    ```

    _Ensure Composer’s global `bin` path is in your system `PATH`_

    #### Now you can run:

    ```bash
    unitary
    ```

</details>

_Local gives consistency, global gives convenience or why not use both? Use what fits your workflow. For most projects a local installation is best as it keeps Unitary tied to your code and version control._

## 1. Create your first test

Unitary automatically finds any PHP file starting with `unitary-` in your project (excluding vendor directory). This behavior can be changed by adding a config file.

> **Note** that all your project files are already autoloaded through Composer, so you can use any of your classes directly in tests, no manual includes or setup required.

#### Create a file named:

```
tests/unitary-user.php
```

#### Example test

```php
use MaplePHP\Unitary\{Unit, TestCase, TestConfig, Expect};

$unit = new Unit();

group("Your grouped test subject", function (TestCase $case) {

    $case->validate("Your test value", function(Expect $expect) {
    
        $expect->isString();
        $expect->length(1, 200);
         
    });
    
});
```

You can also get a ready-to-use boilerplate code with:

```bash
php vendor/bin/unitary template
```

---

## 2. Run your tests

Execute all discovered test groups:

```bash
php vendor/bin/unitary
```

Show only failed validations:

```bash
php vendor/bin/unitary --errors-only
```

For help and all CLI options:

```bash
php vendor/bin/unitary --help
```

---

## No configuration needed

You don’t need to configure anything to start testing, Unitary runs the moment it’s installed.
It automatically discovers your test files, autoloads your project through Composer and prints clear validation results without any complicated setup.

When you want to customize its behavior, you can do this through the CLI or by adding a configuration file.

<details>
  <summary>Add a optional Composer script</summary>

  In your `composer.json`:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "php vendor/bin/unitary"
  }
  ```

  Run with:

  ```bash
  composer test
  ```

  Pass additional arguments using `--`:

  ```bash
  composer test -- --help
  ```
